# ML-based-Thermobarometry

This project uses **ML-based thermobarometry** to estimate **pressure (P)** and **temperature (T)** conditions using **garnet** and **amphibole** mineral data. The data was extracted using **LEPR**, and the model was developed using **Python** code. The code includes steps such as **data cleaning**, missing value imputation using **KNN**, **standardization of data**, training the model using **XgBoost** with hyperparameter tuning using **GridSearchCV** or **RandomizedSearchCV**, and evaluation of the model's performance using **RMSE**, **NRMS**E and **R^2** metrics.
